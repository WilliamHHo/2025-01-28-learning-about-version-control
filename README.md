# Learning about Version Control

William Ho

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

I like version control because it allows me to quickly see exactly what changes have been made without needing to manually compare the previous version with the new version and the fact that you’re able to view previous versions just in case I may have accidentally removed important information from a prior commit. I really dislike trying to deal with different versions where the updated version of a library doesn’t work with an old codebase and you have to figure out what libraries are causing it; this is especially problematic when people don’t keep a local environment file or list of versions for each library they were originally using.
